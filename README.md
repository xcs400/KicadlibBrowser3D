# KicadlibBrowser3D  
Online kicad lib browser for footprints and 3D models.

This is an unfinished work but it can be tested here: https://xcs400.github.io/KicadlibBrowser3D/

My goal is being able to see the Kicad(V5) footprint and 3D models available on Github (mainly from kicad official lib) but also from others author without installing any tool. 

There are no lib here, only links. 

# todo

  -fix bugs (mainly in the .kicad_mod parser) 

  -generate a dynamic list from the official .pretty folder and from others sites (here it is static from modellist.js)

  -setup a better name browser

The Vrml models and footprints are rendered using threejs/webgl : https://threejs.org/ 

The Vrml parser is from https://github.com/bartmcleod/VrmlParser based on Peg.js

The footprint viewver is a (partial) port from C++ to Javascript of the kicad_mod parser found in  https://github.com/compuphase/KiCad-Librarian
